# Drug-Recommender-Using-Vectorization-and-Cosine-Similarity

This is a machine learning-based drug recommendation system implemented as a Python web application using Flask. 
The system enables users to input symptoms and receive a list of recommended drugs based on historical patient data. 
The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, to match user-provided symptoms with reviews of drugs used for similar conditions. 
The system was developed to assist in the efficient selection of drugs, improve patient care, and demonstrate the application of machine learning in a real-world healthcare scenario.
